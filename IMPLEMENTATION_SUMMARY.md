## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Event Discovery

- Fetches STEM events from Eventbrite API every 6 hours
- Searches within 100km radius of user location
- Filters events using comprehensive STEM keyword list
- Prevents duplicate events between sources

### 2. Smart STEM Classification

- Automatically categorizes events by STEM subjects
- Estimates appropriate grade levels and age groups
- Determines virtual vs onsite event types
- Extracts cost and location information

### 3. User Controls

- Settings screen to enable/disable Eventbrite integration
- Auto-refresh toggle for background syncing
- Manual sync button for immediate updates
- Cache management tools

### 4. Visual Indicators

- Orange "Eventbrite" tags on full event cards
- "EB" badges on map carousel cards
- Clear distinction between event sources
- Consistent styling across components

### 5. Performance Optimization

- Local caching (6 hours for Eventbrite, 24 hours for MapSTEM)
- Background sync manager with intelligent scheduling
- Graceful error handling and fallback to cached data
- Debounced search and optimized API calls

## API Configuration

### Eventbrite Credentials:

- **API Key**: ZCMCQB6JRUBO2IOB6G
- **Client Secret**: 6V6VM2SNYISACEYIZN2GKM7BGZHL2GFNNLYFM4PBULB32IKFED
- **Private Token**: 6BV2HHUTQA2WDN5OGAXF
- **Public Token**: KIHZTWNMHR7ISHENYQK7

### Environment Variables Added:

```
EVENTBRITE_API_KEY=ZCMCQB6JRUBO2IOB6G
EVENTBRITE_CLIENT_SECRET=6V6VM2SNYISACEYIZN2GKM7BGZHL2GFNNLYFM4PBULB32IKFED
EVENTBRITE_PRIVATE_TOKEN=6BV2HHUTQA2WDN5OGAXF
EVENTBRITE_PUBLIC_TOKEN=KIHZTWNMHR7ISHENYQK7
ENABLE_EVENTBRITE_INTEGRATION=true
EVENTBRITE_CACHE_DURATION=21600000
API_CACHE_DURATION=86400000
```

## STEM Keywords Used for Filtering

The integration uses 25+ keywords to identify STEM events:

- Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, Mathematics
- STEM, STEAM, Coding, Programming, Robotics
- AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, Computer Science
- Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Astronomy, Geology
- And more...

## User Experience Enhancements

### Map Screen:

- Settings button added (top-right corner)
- Eventbrite events show with "EB" tags on carousel cards
- Combined with existing MapSTEM events seamlessly

### Event List Screen:

- Eventbrite events marked with orange "Eventbrite" tags
- Same filtering and search capabilities
- Distance calculations work for both sources

### Settings Screen:

- Toggle Eventbrite integration on/off
- Enable/disable auto-refresh
- Manual sync button
- Cache management tools
- Developer test screen (debug mode only)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:

1. App loads → Sync manager initializes
2. User location detected → Events fetched from both APIs
3. Events combined and deduplicated
4. Cached locally with timestamps
5. Background sync updates every 6 hours
6. User interactions trigger immediate syncs when needed

### Error Handling:

- Graceful fallback to cached data
- User notifications for sync failures
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- API rate limiting compliance

### Security:

- API keys stored in environment variables
- Token-based authentication
- No user data sent to Eventbrite
- Optional integration (user controllable)

## Testing and Debugging

### Test Screen Features:

- API connectivity testing
- Location-based search validation
- Cache functionality verification
- Performance timing measurements
- Sample event display

### Debug Information:

- Console logging for sync operations
- Error tracking and reporting
- Cache status monitoring
- API response validation

## Installation Requirements

### Dependencies Added:

- `react-native-dotenv` (already installed)
- All other dependencies were already present

### Configuration:

- Babel config updated for environment variables
- No additional native dependencies required
- Works with current Expo setup

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. Test the integration with `npm start`
2. Navigate to Settings → Test Eventbrite Integration (dev mode)
3. Verify events appear on map and in list views
4. Test manual sync functionality

### Future Enhancements:

1. Machine learning for better STEM classification
2. User preference learning
3. Push notifications for new events
4. Admin dashboard for monitoring
5. Integration with additional event platforms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No Eventbrite events**: Check API keys and internet connection
2. **Outdated events**: Clear cache or force manual sync
3. **Performance issues**: Check sync frequency settings
4. **Events not showing**: Verify location permissions

### Debug Steps:

1. Use the test screen to verify API connectivity
2. Check console logs for error messages
3. Clear cache if data seems stale
4. Verify settings are properly saved

## Support and Maintenance

### Monitoring:

- Check sync manager logs regularly
- Monitor API usage and rate limits
- Update STEM keywords as needed
- Review event quality and relevance

### Updates:

- API credentials may need renewal
- Eventbrite API changes require code updates
- STEM classification can be improved over time
- User feedback should drive feature enhancements

The integration is now complete and ready for testing. Users will have access to a much larger pool of STEM educational events while maintaining the quality and locality focus of the original MapSTEM platform.
